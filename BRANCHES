This repo follows a standard git branching scheme.

* master - stable branch
* dev - unstable development branch

All other branches are feature branches. Some may be orphans and some
may eventually be merged into dev. The master branch will only merge
changes from dev after we are satisfied they are stable.

Tags with format vX.Y.Z are considered releases of stable versions.
All other tags are considered experimental.
